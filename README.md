## 🎯 Objective

Nova is a powerful multimodal AI assistant that seamlessly integrates vision, speech, and text-based interactions. It helps users by describing their environment, engaging in natural conversations, and responding intelligently through voice and chat. Nova is designed to serve a wide range of users, including the visually impaired, busy professionals, and anyone seeking a smarter, more intuitive way to interact with technology.

## 🏁 Final Words

What a journey this hackathon has been! From the very beginning, we had to juggle so many moving parts—text, voice, and images—and making them work together felt like solving a huge puzzle. The biggest challenge was definitely getting everything to run smoothly and quickly without any hiccups. But, after some long nights and lots of coffee, we managed to make it happen!

One of the most exciting moments was when the bot nailed its first image response. It felt like we were on the verge of something big, and that made all the tough moments worth it.

A huge thanks to my amazing team for the teamwork, the laughs, and sticking through the tough times. And, of course, a big shout-out to our mentors who were there whenever we needed guidance or a reality check. You all made this experience unforgettable!

Can’t wait to keep pushing Nova to new heights!
